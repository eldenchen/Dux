/**
 * The find panel assumes you will have a background therad searching for results. To do it, you must:
 *
 * call -beginAddingFindResults. This tells the find panel all previously added find results are probably not valid anymore, but will not actually remove those results from the panel.
 * call -addFindResult: for each result. The dictionary must contain a @"name" property, in addition to any other custom data you want attached to the name.
 * call -endAddingFindResults. This tells the find panel you've finished searching and everything just added is up to date.
 * 
 * begin/end calls do not need to be paired perfectly, just call begin whenever you start searching from scratch, and end whenever you have *finished* searching.
